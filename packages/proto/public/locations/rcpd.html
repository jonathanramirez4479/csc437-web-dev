        The Raccoon City Police Department (RPD) is a fictional law enforcement
        agency in the Resident Evil video game series, created by Capcom. It's
        located in the heart of Raccoon City, a midwestern American town that
        becomes the epicenter of a viral outbreak. The police department
        operates out of a renovated art museum, giving the building an eerie,
        elaborate design. It becomes a key setting in Resident Evil 2, where
        players explore its dark, abandoned corridors while evading zombies and
        other creatures. The RPD is notable for its central role in the events
        leading up to the city's destruction.
