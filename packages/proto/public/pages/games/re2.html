        >The game begins with a truck driver hauling oil driving through the
        plains of Arklay County, entirely unaware of the recent quarantine of
        Raccoon City. Tired, eating a burger and listening to a talk radio
        program featuring an eye-witness to Zombies, the truck plows straight
        into a what seems like a woman walking on the highway. Panicked and
        scared, the driver gets out of the truck to inspect on the woman. But
        the woman rises up while his back is turned and attacks him. Elsewhere
        in the plains, police rookie Leon S. Kennedy and university student
        Claire Redfield stop off at the Mizoil Gas Station to fill up on petrol.
        The first to arrive investigates a smashing sound inside, and finds an
        Arklays County sheriff deputy being attacked by a Zombie. Zombies flock
        from the surrounding area to the gas station, cornering Leon and Claire.
        The two meet at the entrance, and evade the horde of zombies as they
        rush to the deputy's car, which Leon drives into the city.</span
